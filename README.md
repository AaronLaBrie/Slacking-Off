# Slacking-Off

Enables a host of stupid slash commands for Slack via [Heroku](https://slacking-off.herokuapp.com/).
I want to use this on more than one slack team... and slack did away with the easier-to-use-in-this-case custom integrations... so this is an "App" now.

Just click the button and you'll get a bunch of dumb slash commands, mostly outdated dota jokes.
